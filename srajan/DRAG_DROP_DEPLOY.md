## ⚠️ Important Note

For the full app to work, you also need to deploy the backend:
- Use **Render.com** for backend (free)
- See `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md` for full instructions

## 🔧 Quick Backend Setup

If you want the full app working:

1. **Deploy Backend**:
   - Go to: https://render.com
   - New Web Service
   - Connect GitHub repo
   - Root directory: `backend`
   - Deploy

2. **Update Frontend**:
   - Netlify → Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add: `VITE_API_URL` = your Render backend URL
   - Redeploy
