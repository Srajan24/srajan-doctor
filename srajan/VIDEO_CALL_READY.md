# ✅ Video Calling is NOW CONFIGURED!

## 🎉 What I Did

✅ **Verified Agora credentials** in backend `.env`  
✅ **Added Agora App ID** to frontend `.env`  
✅ **Updated code** to use environment variables  
✅ **Everything is ready** to use!

## 🚀 How to Test Video Calling

### Step 1: Restart Frontend (IMPORTANT!)

The frontend needs to restart to load the new environment variable:

```bash
# Stop the frontend (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Then restart:
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Or just run the startup script again:
```powershell
.\start-dev.ps1
```

### Step 2: Create Test Accounts

You need 2 users to test video calling:

**Option A: Use 2 Browsers**
- Browser 1 (Chrome): Patient account
- Browser 2 (Firefox/Incognito): Doctor account

**Option B: Use 2 Devices**
- Computer: Patient account
- Phone: Doctor account

### Step 3: Set Up Accounts

1. **Doctor Account**:
   - Sign up at http://localhost:5173
   - Choose "Doctor" role
   - Fill in specialty, experience, credentials
   - Wait for admin approval (you're the admin!)

2. **Admin Approval**:
   - Log in as admin (srajantherockstar76@gmail.com)
   - Go to Admin Dashboard
   - Approve the doctor

3. **Patient Account**:
   - Sign up (different email)
   - Choose "Patient" role

### Step 4: Book an Appointment

1. **As Patient**:
   - Browse doctors
   - Select the doctor you created
   - Choose a time slot
   - Book appointment

2. **Video Session Created**:
   - Agora channel is automatically created
   - Token is generated
   - Saved with the appointment

### Step 5: Join Video Call

1. **Both users** go to "Appointments" page
2. Find the scheduled appointment
3. Click **"Join Video Call"** button
4. **Allow camera and microphone** when browser asks
5. You should see each other! 🎥

## 🎮 Video Call Controls

Once in the call:

- 📹 **Camera Toggle**: Turn video on/off

## 🎯 Your Agora Configuration

**Backend** (`backend/.env`):
```
AGORA_APP_ID=c3f5a580fd8d475cba3e64eee2027e3f
AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=a4f1934c4a2b4229b779f4019d5bdf93
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env`):
```
VITE_AGORA_APP_ID=c3f5a580fd8d475cba3e64eee2027e3f
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Join Video Call" button not showing
- Make sure appointment is scheduled (not cancelled/completed)
- Refresh the page

### "Invalid video call parameters"
- **Restart frontend** to load new env variable
- Check that appointment has `videoSessionId` and `videoToken`
- Book a new appointment (old ones might not have tokens)

### Camera/Mic not working
- Click "Allow" when browser asks for permissions
- Check browser address bar for blocked permissions
- Go to browser settings → Privacy → Camera/Microphone

### No remote video
- Make sure both users clicked "Join Video Call"
- Both must be in the same appointment
- Check internet connection

### Black screen
- Allow camera permissions
- Check if camera is being used by another app
- Try refreshing the page

## 📱 Browser Requirements

**Desktop:**
- ✅ Chrome 58+ (Recommended)
- ✅ Firefox 56+
- ✅ Edge 79+
- ✅ Safari 11+

**Mobile:**
- ✅ Chrome (Android)
- ✅ Safari (iOS)

## 🎥 What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Appointment Booking**:
   ```
   Patient books → Backend generates unique channel
   → Creates Agora token → Saves to appointment
   ```

2. **Joining Call**:
   ```
   User clicks "Join" → Frontend gets channel + token
   → Agora SDK connects → Video/audio streams start
   ```

3. **During Call**:
   ```
   Real-time video/audio via Agora servers
   → Low latency, high quality
   → Automatic reconnection if needed
   ```

## 💡 Tips for Best Experience

1. **Good Internet**: At least 1 Mbps for video calls
2. **Good Lighting**: Face a window or light source
3. **Quiet Environment**: Use headphones to avoid echo
4. **Close Other Apps**: Free up bandwidth
5. **Test First**: Do a test call before real appointments

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Everything is configured and ready to use! Just:

1. **Restart frontend** (important!)
2. **Create test accounts**
3. **Book an appointment**
4. **Click "Join Video Call"**
