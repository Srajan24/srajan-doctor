## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend

**New Model**: `InstantCall`
- Tracks emergency call requests
- Stores status (pending, accepted, rejected, completed)
- Links patient and doctor
- Stores video session details

**New Routes**: `/api/instant-call/`
- `GET /available-doctors` - List online doctors
- `POST /request` - Patient requests call
- `GET /patient/status` - Check call status
- `GET /doctor/pending` - Doctor's pending calls
- `POST /respond` - Doctor accepts/rejects
- `POST /doctor/toggle-availability` - Go online/offline
- `POST /end` - End the call

**User Model Updates**:
- `isAvailableForInstantCall` - Doctor's online status
- `instantCallPrice` - Credits for emergency call (default: 3)

### Frontend

**New Pages**:
- `/emergency-call` - Patient view (see available doctors)
- `/doctor/call-requests` - Doctor view (manage requests)

**New Components**:
- `EmergencyCallPage` - Patient interface
- `DoctorCallRequests` - Doctor interface
- `Badge` - Status badges
- `Textarea` - Emergency description input

**New Actions**: `instantCall.js`
- API calls for all emergency call operations

**Solution**:
- Doctors must go to `/doctor/call-requests`

**Problem**: Doctor doesn't see the request

**Solution**:
- Make sure doctor is online (green "Available" badge)
- Page auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
